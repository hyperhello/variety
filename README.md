# variety
Java App to solve polynomials and chart results.

I learned to solve Groebner bases from a book called Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms and wrote this for a presentation of a multivariate calculus problem. 

Given a polynomial system written as ordinary equations, it will solve down to the fewest dimensions possible, emit working Java functions to calculate variables as functions of the others, and graph outputs with respect to chosen variables. I got an A.
